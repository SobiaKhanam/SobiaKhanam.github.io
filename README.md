    <h3>Projects</h3>
    
    <p><strong>1. Data Analysis and Decision Support System</strong><br>
    <a href="https://github.com/SobiaKhanam/DADSS/tree/main/ais" target="_blank">Project Link</a><br>
    The DADSS project is a Django-based backend platform designed to support marine surveillance, policy-making, and operational decisions by analyzing real-time vessel movement data. It enables stakeholders to monitor vessel traffic, assess port activity, and identify patterns using structured filtering, historical trends, and automated insights. The system processes large-scale marine datasets and exposes them through RESTful APIs to feed into dashboards and visualizations.<br>
    <em><strong>Skills:</strong> Django, Python, Pandas, REST API, PostgreSQL, Django ORM, Django REST Framework, Data Modeling</em>
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>2. Maritime Vessel Analysis using DAX Queries</strong><br>
    <a href="https://github.com/SobiaKhanam/PowerBI-Dashboard" target="_blank">Project Link</a><br>
    Built a series of industry-relevant DAX queries in Power BI's Query View to explore maritime vessel activity from a structured dataset. The analysis includes year-on-year growth, monthly active vessels, flag-wise vessel distribution, and vessel type breakdowns. Queries are designed for data exploration and storytelling without relying on visuals, showcasing strong command of data modeling and query logic within Power BI.<br>
    <em><strong>Skills:</strong> Power BI, DAX Query View, Data Exploration, Time Series Analysis, Grouping & Aggregation, Year-over-Year Growth, Geospatial Insights, Maritime Data Analytics</em>
    </p>

    <p><strong>3. Face Recognition Web-Based System</strong><br>
    <a href="https://github.com/SobiaKhanam/DADSS/blob/main/face_recognition/views.py" target="_blank">Project Link</a><br>
    A web application that allows users to upload an image and matches it against a stored database using facial recognition techniques. Designed to support identification and verification of marine crew members and enhance onboard personnel tracking and security.<br>
    <em><strong>Skills:</strong> Python, face-recognition library, ML, Django</em>
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>4. Vessel Trajectory Cost Analysis</strong><br>
    <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gynsAH69B2_nN6tCYLlS1_7eIbHzC5AH#scrollTo=YWCUkOfOXPIw" target="_blank">Project Link</a><br>
    Analyzed marine vessel trajectories to calculate the cost associated with each route based on spatial path deviations and distance metrics. Used clustering algorithms like DBSCAN to identify typical versus abnormal movement patterns, helping to detect inefficient or suspicious routes. The analysis aids in improving maritime navigation efficiency and monitoring route compliance.<br>
    <em><strong>Skills:</strong> Google Colab, Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn (DBSCAN), Geospatial Analysis</em>
    </p>

    <p><strong>5. Fishing Activity Heatmap using Gaussian KDE</strong><br>
    <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NHQVwAi3q2smjPXcJb-1LAZSPSMu-32h#scrollTo=KALa-2OU61Ih" target="_blank">Project Link</a><br>
    Developed an interactive heatmap from scratch to visualize fishing activity density using Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). The project leverages geospatial vessel data to highlight fishing hotspots. A dynamic legend was implemented, allowing users to control key visualization parameters such as threshold and radius, providing customizable insights for maritime surveillance and decision-making.<br>
  <em><strong>Skills:</strong> Google Colab, Python, Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, KDE, Data Visualization, Geospatial Analysis, Folium</em>
    </p>

    <p><strong>6. Object-Following Robot using Jetson Nano</strong><br>
    <a href="https://github.com/SobiaKhanam/Object-Following-Robot" target="_blank">Project Link</a><br>
Designed and developed an object-following robot as part of a Computer Vision course project, leveraging the Jetson Nano platform and OpenCV library. The system uses live video feed to detect and track a target object in real-time, adjusting motor control to follow its movement. This project showcases the integration of AI-based vision with embedded hardware for intelligent robotic behavior.<br>
  <em><strong>Skills:</strong> Jetson Nano, OpenCV, Python, Computer Vision, Real-time Object Tracking, Embedded Systems</em>
